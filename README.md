## Description

![Homepage](Home.png)

This project aims to be a skill based role portal that allows users to upskill themselves by searching and applying for company-internal roles based on their skills and experience. It is built with the frontend using Vue.JS and the backend using Python Flask. The database used is MySQL.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.x)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) (v8.0)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.11)

### Frontend

For the frontend, simply run the commands below.

```
# In root directory
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend

For the backend, we will be using Python Flask and a local MySQL server. No API keys are required for this application.

```
# In root directory
cd backend
pip/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

Next, create a .env file with the following contents:

```python
# In backend directory
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
```

For the sample data, it is not stored in the repo, but you may use execute [init.sql](https://github.com/darylcwx/skillbasedroleportal/blob/main/init.sql) as the schema for the database, then load a .csv with their respective SQL table columns like so:

```bash
# In root directory
python load_init_sql.py
```

## Development

For development, you may run both the frontend and backend concurrently on separate terminals. On frontend you should see this:

```javascript
  VITE v4.4.9  ready in XXX ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
  âžœ  press h to show help
```

And on the backend you should see this:

```python
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
```

This means that once you load the data in correctly, the application will be fully functional.

## Roadmap

Tentatively, this application was done up for a school project and will not be maintained in the future.

- [ ] First release (v1.0.0 - 07/11/23)
